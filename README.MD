This project focuses on developing a system that recognizes correct answers from a test paper using image processing methods. This system simplifies the process of grading tests and reduces the time and effort required by teachers.

To carry out this project, we first need to build a dataset of test paper images and corresponding correct answers. Next, we use image processing methods such as edge detection, image segmentation, and character recognition to extract the answers from the test paper images.

After extracting the answers from the test paper images, we use a string matching algorithm to compare the extracted answers with the correct answers in the dataset to determine the correct answer for each question.

The result of the project will be an efficient system that recognizes correct answers from test papers and can be integrated into automated grading applications to help teachers and students save time and effort in the grading process.
